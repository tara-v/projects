This project was completed as part of DATASCI-200: 	
Introduction to Data Science Programming at the UC Berkeley School of Information in collaboration with Godsee Joy.

Our primary dataset was the Climate & Economic Justice Screening tool, found [here](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/), and our secondary datasets were sourced from [IPUMS](https://terra.ipums.org/environmental-data).

As part of our analysis, we also used census and county-level shape files from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.html). These files are too large to include in the repository, but the Geospatial Analysis notebook contains the corresponding output.
